What is C#?
C# (pronounced “C-Sharp”) is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft.

1.1 Objects & Controls
Object: A program component that contains data (properties) and performs operations (methods). Programs use objects to perform specific tasks.

Controls: Objects that are visible in a program's GUI. The most commonly used controls are Labels, Buttons, and TextBoxes.

Class: Code that describes a particular type of object.

.NET Framework: A collection of classes and other code used to create programs for the Windows operating system.

1.2 Getting Started with Visual Studio
Visual Studio is a professional Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Key components of the environment include:

Designer Window: Used to visually design the application's user interface.

Solution Explorer Window: Displays and manages project files and solutions.

Properties Window: Displays and allows you to edit the properties of selected controls or forms.

Toolbox: A panel used to select and add controls to a form.

2.1 Getting Started with Forms and Controls
When you create a new Windows Forms App, an empty form named Form1 is automatically created.

Properties Window: Properties govern the appearance and behavior of GUI objects. Example: The Text property sets the title text displayed on the form or control.

Naming Rules for Controls (Identifiers):

The first character must be a letter (A–Z, a–z) or an underscore (_).

Names cannot contain spaces.

2.2 Creating the GUI for Your First Visual C# Application
Designing the GUI involves placing a Form and a Button control onto the workspace. When the button is clicked, it will display the message "Hello World".

2.3 Introduction to C# Code
C# source code is structured in three primary hierarchical levels:

Namespace: A container that holds classes.

Class: A container that holds methods.

Method: A group of statements that execute to perform a specific task.

Default Source Code Files:

Program.cs: Contains the startup code executed when the application runs.

Form1.cs: Contains the code associated with the Form1 user interface.

Event-Driven Programming: GUI programs respond to user actions (events) such as clicking a button or pressing a key. Double-clicking a control in the Designer automatically generates an Event Handler method.

2.4 Writing Code for the Hello World Application
To display a pop-up message box, use the MessageBox.Show method:

C#
private void messageButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Hello World");
}
2.5 Label Controls
Label Control: Used to display non-editable text or program output on a form.

Key Properties: Text, Name, Font, BorderStyle, AutoSize, and TextAlign.

Displaying output programmatically via code:

C#
answerLabel.Text = "Jamhuuriya University";
Clearing text in a Label control:

C#
answerLabel.Text = "";
2.6 Making Sense of IntelliSense
IntelliSense: An intelligent code completion tool that suggests matching keywords, variables, methods, and properties as you type, reducing coding errors and typing time.

2.7 PictureBox Controls
PictureBox: A control used to display graphic images on a form.

Key Properties: Image, SizeMode, and Visible.

Sequential Execution: Code statements execute sequentially in the exact order they are written from top to bottom.

2.8 Comments, Blank Lines, and Indentation
Single-Line Comment: Begins with two forward slashes (//).

Block Comment: Begins with /* and ends with */.
